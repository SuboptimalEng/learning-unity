# ðŸ“š Learning Unity

### Description

This repo contains the code for the tutorials I followed to learn the
basics of Unity. On average, I spent 6-10 hours on each tutorial series.

### Learning Approach

Complete many tutorials as quickly as possible to turn `unknown unknowns`
into `known unknowns`. This, in theory, should help me build a mental
model of what to Google when I'm stuck.

### Quick Tip

It is important to `choose a tutorial that goes at a pace that matches your
current knowledge level`. Choosing a tutorial that is too difficult is like
training for a marathon by running 20 miles on the first day. You won't
get far and will be demotivated very quickly.

I learned this lesson when I started Sebastian Lague's Procedural Terrain
Generation series. It took my 3-4 days to complete 14/21 tutorials. This
was a slow pace for me and I was started to get frustrated with my lack
of quick progress.

After taking a step back to think about my pacing, I realized I was trying
to learn too much too quickly. If I could go back in time, I would've done
this as my 9th or 10th tutorial (once I felt more comfortable with Unity)
instead of doing it as my 5th one.
